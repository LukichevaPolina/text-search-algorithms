# Text Search Algorithms  üìÑüîç
An aplication helps to use and compare different text search algorithms on various types of text. The project was build as coursework.
## How it use?

### Text generation
In this application you can choose one of three types of text:
* Full random - the string consisting of random characters
* Random words - the text consisting of random words
* Text - parsing text
Then enter size (in symbol or words) and count of texts.

### Algorithm settings
Also you need to select one of four algorithm type:
* Naive Matcher
* Rabin Karp
* Boyer Moor Horspool
* KMP

### Pattern setings
Enter number of pattern. They will be included in each randon text. This is necessary for comfortable comparing of algorithms.
Use tupe of pattern:
* Manual
* Generate
If you use "Manual", you must enter pattern.

## Results
Result will be available after clicking the button "OK" on tab "Result"
Tab devided into two parts.

### General result
This part shows average result for all text:
* Number of pattern
* Number of comparisons
* Number of extra operations
* Memory waste

### Current text result
This part can show choosing text and its results.
